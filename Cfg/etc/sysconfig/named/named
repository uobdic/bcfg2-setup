# BIND named process options
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Currently, you can use the following options:
#
# ROOTDIR="/var/named/chroot"  --  will run named in a chroot environment.
#                            you must set up the chroot environment 
#                            (install the bind-chroot package) before
#                            doing this.
#       NOTE:
#         Those directories are automatically mounted to chroot if they are
#         empty in the ROOTDIR directory. It will simplify maintenance of your
#         chroot environment.
#          - /var/named
#          - /etc/pki/dnssec-keys
#          - /etc/named
#          - /usr/lib64/bind or /usr/lib/bind (architecture dependent)
#
#         Those files are mounted as well if target file doesn't exist in
#         chroot.
#          - /etc/named.conf
#          - /etc/rndc.conf
#          - /etc/rndc.key
#          - /etc/named.rfc1912.zones
#          - /etc/named.dnssec.keys
#          - /etc/named.iscdlv.key
#
#       Don't forget to add "$AddUnixListenSocket /var/named/chroot/dev/log"
#       line to your /etc/rsyslog.conf file. Otherwise your logging becomes
#       broken when rsyslogd daemon is restarted (due update, for example).
#
# OPTIONS="whatever"     --  These additional options will be passed to named
#                            at startup. Don't add -t here, use ROOTDIR instead.
#
# KEYTAB_FILE="/dir/file"    --  Specify named service keytab file (for GSS-TSIG)
#
# DISABLE_ZONE_CHECKING  -- By default, initscript calls named-checkzone
#                           utility for every zone to ensure all zones are
#                           valid before named starts. If you set this option
#                           to 'yes' then initscript doesn't perform those
#                           checks.
ROOTDIR=/var/named/chroot
#use only IPV4 (default is IPV6)
